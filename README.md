This repository contains the code and instructions needed to build a sophisticated search engine that leverages the capabilities of [Groq](https://www.groq.com/), [Mistral AI's Mixtral](https://mistral.ai/news/mixtral-of-experts/), [Langchain.JS](https://js.langchain.com/docs/), [Brave Search](https://search.brave.com/), [Serper API](https://serper.dev/), and [OpenAI](https://openai.com/). Designed to efficiently return sources, answers, images, videos, and follow-up questions based on user queries, this project is an ideal starting point for developers interested in natural language processing and search technologies.
